A simple web app that connects to a Studio Ghibli API, retrieves the data with JavaScript, and displays it on the front end of a website.

Updated to use fetch API, widely [supported](https://caniuse.com/#feat=fetch) in most modern browsers.
Note a [polyfill](https://github.com/github/fetch) is available, but as this is only a demo I haven't included it.
