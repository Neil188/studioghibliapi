A simple web app that connects to a Studio Ghibli API, retrieves the data with JavaScript, and displays it on the front end of a website.

Updated to use fetch API, widely [supported](https://caniuse.com/#feat=fetch) in most modern browsers.
Note a [polyfill](https://github.com/github/fetch) is available, but as this is only a demo I haven't included it.

## Installation Instructions

1. Clone locally using:

    `git clone https://github.com/Neil188/studioghibliapi.git`

2. Install dependencies (Eslint and prettier, no dependencies required to run the code so this can be skipped) :

    `npm install`

3. To build minified files in dist folder:

    `npm run build`

    Files can now be tested from dist/index.html

4. To push latest build to Git Hub pages:

    `npm run deploy`

    Note this will re-run build first.
    Make sure 'homepage' setting in package.json is correct before running deploy.
